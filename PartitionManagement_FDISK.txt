There are number of ways to manage disk in linux - Fdisk,Parted and GParted
The fdisk command is a text-based utility for viewing and managing hard disk partitions on Linux. It’s one of the most powerful tools you can use to manage partitions, but it’s confusing to new users.

On Ubuntu, Linux Mint or other Ubuntu-derived distributions, the fdisk and mkfs commands must be prefixed with 'sudo'.
On distributions that don’t use sudo, use the 'su' command first to get a root shell, then type every command without sudo.
Hard Disk Device Files avilable in '/dev/' , here device name is 'sdb'

1)Lists the partitions on your system.
     # fdisk -l
2)List only specific device(Disk) partitions.
     # fdisk -l /dev/sdb
3)To work on a disk’s partitions, you have to enter command mode. You’ll need the 
  device name of a disk from the 'fdisk -l' command.
     # fdisk /dev/sdb
4)Use single-letter commands to specify actions you want to take. Type 'm' and 
  press Enter to see a list of the commands  
     # Command (m for help): m
5)Creating a Partition : Use the 'n' command to create a new partition. You can  
  create a logical or primary partition (e for extended ,l for logical or p for 
  primary) 
  Next, specify the sector of the disk you want the partition to start at. Press  
  Enter to accept the default sector, which is the first free sector on the disk.
  Last, specify the last sector of the partition on the disk. If you want to use 
  up all available space after the initial sector, just press Enter. You can also 
  specify a specific size, such as +5G for a five gigabyte partition or +512M for 
  a 512 megabyte partition. If you don’t specify a unit after the + sign, fdisk 
  uses sectors as the unit.  
6)Deleting a Partition :Use the 'd' command to delete a partition. You’ll be 
  asked for the number of the partition you want to delete, which you can get  
  from the 'p' command. 
7)Viewing the Partition Table : Use p to print the current partition table to the 
  terminal from within command mode.     
8)System ID : view a list of hex codes enter 'L'  
9)Writing Changes : Use 'w' to write the changes you’ve made to disk.
10)Formatting a Partition :You must format new partitions with a file system 
   before you can use them
	   # mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1
15)If you want format a partition as a swap partition:   
	   # sudo mkswap /dev/sdb2
16)If you want format a partition with NTFS:
	   # mkfs -t NTFS /dev/sdb3
17)Before using the disk, create a mount point and mount the partition to it. A  
   mount point is a directory used to access data stored in disks.
	   # mkdir -p [mountpoint] 
	   # mount -t auto /dev/sdb1 [mountpoint]
       Replace [mountpoint] with the preferred mount point (example:/usr/media)
	   	   		   
18)'lsblk' command that displays block devices. Block devices are files that represent devices such as hard drives, RAM disks, USB drives, and CD/ROM drives.	   
19)Disable swap partition
       # swapoff -a
20)Enable swap partition
       # swapon -a  
21)Verify the memory using 'free'
       # free -m
       
Universally Unique Identifiers, or UUIDS, are 128 bit numbers, composed of 16 octets and represented as 32 base-16 characters, that can be used to identify information across a computer system.
